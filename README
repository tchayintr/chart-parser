This directory composed of a set of basic programs of chart parsing.
You can use these programs as you like, but without any guarantee if
any inconvenience is occurred by these programs.

--
Explanation:

 * To compile this directory, type

   % make		 # for three versions: chart,chartill,chartpure
   % make chart          # for chart     version
   % make chartill       # for chartill  version
   % make chartpure      # for chartpure version

 * There are three versions of chart parsing algorithms in this
   directory: chart, chartill, chartpure

   chart version:
	This program parses a sentence under a grammar given in
        'gram/gram'. There is two transverse tables to convert between
        EDR version's categories and PENNTREE version's categories.
        The tables are denoted in 'src/trancat.c' and 'src/trancat.h'.

   chartill  version:
        This program is an extension of chart version to parse
        ill-formed inputs under the algorithm given in [1]-[3]. 

   chartpure version:
        This program is a pure chart parsing algorithm. There is no
        convert table anymore. It seems to be the most general version
        which you can use for parsing a sentence under a grammar.

 * How to change a grammar and What is the form of input sentences ?

   == Chart and Chartill version ==

   [Grammar]
     You can change a grammar for parsing by replacing a grammar file
     located at 'gram/gram' with the one you want for chart and chartill
     version. 

   [Input sentences]
     In chart and chartill version, the sentence has to be in the form
     of 'word/category'. The following is an example:

"the/DT Secretariat/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ international/JJ conference/NN of/IN interpreting/VBG telephony/NN"

   == Chartpure version ==

   [Grammar]
     For chartpure version, you have to replace a grammar file named
     'gram/grampure' with the suitable one.

   [Input sentences]
     The sentence you want to parse should be in the form of 'a sequence
     of lexical tags' for chartpure version. An example is shown below.

     DT NNP IN DT JJ JJ NN IN VBG NN

 * How to run the program ?

   Ex.)

   % chart < demo_example/ex_sentences

   % chartill 1 1 1 1 < demo_example/ex_sentences

   % chartpure 1 < demo_example/ex_sentences1
